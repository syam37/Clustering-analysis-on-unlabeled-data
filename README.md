**Clustering-analysis-on-unlabeled-data**
I am going to explore a dataset of employees(salaried employees of a city hyderabad) with clustering algorithms. My intention is to see range of settled employees in hyderabad city like well-settled,still struggling to settle,fresher to get settle,stress less living employees,not well settled  based on their experience, salary, qualification,designation, working company..etc.
Here i am using KMeans, KMedoids, SOM clustering algorithms and I am going to compare these clustering algorithms whether they are giving the clusters as i thought and conclude with better clustering algorithm for this dataset
**About the dataset:**

It is a dataset with 28848 records with 9 attributes(columns). I had chosen the dataset at kaggle. It is a dataset of salaried employee data with their name,company,designation, experience,location and salary,category,etc.,
